# German-Air-Fare-Analysis
In this analysis, I delve into a dataset that contains information about air fares in Germany. My goal is to uncover patterns and insights that could potentially influence pricing strategies and customer behavior. I explore various factors such as departure and arrival airports, flight duration, booking period, and more.

I begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure itâ€™s in the right format for my analysis. Then proceed to create new features that could provide additional insights, such as the route taken (a combination of the departure and arrival cities).

This analysis involves a variety of visualizations including bar plots and heatmap, which help us better understand the relationships between different variables. For instance, we examine the average price per departure airport, arrival airport, and booking period. We also look at the correlation between flight duration and price.

Through this EDA, my aim is to provide valuable insights that could be useful for both customers looking to find the best deals and airlines aiming to optimize their pricing strategies. We hope you find this analysis informative and insightful!
